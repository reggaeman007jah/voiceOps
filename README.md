# voiceOps

Welcome

This is a little project designed to explore automated CTI style missions, and also designed to have fun and learn about scripting for Arma 3. 

I have some loose ideas about players (MP) being given orders to deploy containers, that in turn spawn certain types of bases (barracks, repair, radar etc), which when built enables the AI forces to do certain things.

E.g., create barracks, and then Blufor AI will spawn every so often, go out on patrol and look for enemies. 

Every so often, players will be told to resupply bases, extract injured, do CAS runs etc (still loose on all that).

There will be lots of ambient combat and effects, and will also explore caching and virtual assets to ensure good performance.

This is an open project, so please let me know if you want to get involved.

Cheers
Reggs
