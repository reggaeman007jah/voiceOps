Things to do...

generate ambient combat zones
selecting location for battlezone
generating opfor
generating blufor
pitching against eachother - move orders
checking for blufor win/lose status
running mission clock - end mission after x mins

types of missions
CAS
Medevac
MH6 Insertion
MH6 Pickup > RTB ¦¦ new location
Huron Insertion > RTB ¦¦ new location
FAC / CAS (needs more thought)

missions are created when pilot gets into a particular heli
AH6 > CAS
MH6 > Insertion / Pickup / small numbers
Huron > Insertion / Pickup / large numbers

Voice Ops Ideas (example)
You're in a heli, you get voice message telling you to:
pickup x troops
they are x m from your current location
heading xxx
grid ref xxxx xxxx
area is hot
pick up on green smoke

We need to enable both totally random skirmishes as well as more defined missions
