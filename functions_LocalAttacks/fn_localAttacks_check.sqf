/*
This Function will decide which base should be attacked by a local camp 

Notes:
When all local bases are destroyed, this will stop (i.e. LOCALATTACK will be false)
This will run every x seconds until all camps are dealt with 

We check whether dead camps == 9, if 9 then process stops 
Else, we ID what bases are live, and from there what camps are near live bases 

Extended Notes:
we want to create local attacks against bases, which will continue until the camp is found and destroyed 
for each base created, a camp will be created 
each camp creation pushes a camp pos to a global array 
each camp destroyed deletes that pos from the candidates array and pushes to the destroyed camps array 
when destroyed camps == 9, job is done 

_campData = [_heliPad, _campSitePos, "barracks"];
RGG_potentialEnemyCamps pushBack _campData;
